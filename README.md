# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-and-Insights-Report
Executive Summary
The review of historical energy data identifies, within the context of production, consumption, and efficiency, trends such as the growth of renewable energy, seasonal difficulties, dependence on fossil fuel, and the need for energy efficiency. Key findings reveal relations between energy imports and consumption, while renewables can be tripled by 2040. Recommendations are made towards more renewable adoption, improving the infrastructure, and reduction in import reliance. It depends on sound data sets and methods, including time series and correlation mapping that optimizes the energy systems for sustainability. Limitations involve gaps in data and constraints of the model.
